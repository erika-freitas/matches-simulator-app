# Matches Simulator Android App

This is a guided project by DIO's instructor [Venilton FalvoJr](https://github.com/falvojr).

### Notes:

-  You may notice some duplicated files (ie MainActivity, MainActivityJava) that's for educational proposes, to understand and compare codes in Java and Kotlin since I'm new at both. The idea is to refactor it later. 
- This repo uses a mock API, and you can find it here: [matches-simulator-api](https://github.com/erika-freitas/matches-simulator-api)
